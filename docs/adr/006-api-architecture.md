# ADR 006: API Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The API will follow RESTful principles to provide a structured and scalable interface for data access and manipulation.

## Decision
- Use FastAPI for its asynchronous capabilities and built-in OpenAPI support.

## Considerations
- FastAPI simplifies the creation of high-performance APIs.
- OpenAPI support ensures documentation is generated automatically.

## Consequences
- Developers must be familiar with asynchronous programming in Python.
- Testing and validation tools are essential to maintain API integrity.
