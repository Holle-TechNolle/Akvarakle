# ADR 0001: Record Architecture Decisions

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We aim to create a robust, well-documented, and beginner-friendly database solution for managing aquarium data.

## Decision
1. Use MySQL for the database to align with both local and cloud-based hosting (OCI Free).
2. Employ Python for backend development.
3. Use MkDocs for documentation and ADRs for tracking design decisions.

## Consequences
- Contributors must be familiar with Python and MySQL.
- Documentation is centralized for ease of access and navigation.
- ADRs provide transparency and a historical record of decisions.
