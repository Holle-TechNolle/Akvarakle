# ADR 002: Development Language

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Python has been chosen as the primary development language for the project due to its widespread adoption, extensive library support, and suitability for data-driven applications.

## Decision
- Use Python for all API, data processing, and related backend tasks.

## Considerations
- Pythonâ€™s ecosystem includes tools like Flask/FastAPI for APIs and MkDocs for documentation.
- The language is highly readable and beginner-friendly, enabling easier onboarding.

## Consequences
- Dependency on Python libraries requires maintaining compatibility with current versions.
- Performance optimizations may be necessary for compute-intensive tasks.
